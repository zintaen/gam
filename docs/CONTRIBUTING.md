## Development Workflow

### Project Structure

| Directory         | Purpose                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| `src-tauri/`      | Tauri backend (Rust)       |
| `src-tauri/src/`  | Rust commands and services |
| `src/`            | React frontend             |
| `src/components/` | Reusable UI components     |
| `src/hooks/`      | Custom React hooks         |
| `tests/`          | Unit tests (Vitest)        |

### Useful Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start Tauri + Vite dev server
pnpm test         # Run all tests
pnpm test -- --coverage # Run tests with coverage report
pnpm test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm build        # Build for production
```

### Adding a New Feature

1. Create a branch from `main`:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    ```
2. Implement your changes.
3. Add or update tests in `tests/`.
4. Ensure all tests pass: `pnpm test`
5. Submit a pull request.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature per PR** — Keep changes focused and reviewable.
- **Write tests** — New core features should include unit tests. UI features should use `@testing-library/react`.
- **Update docs** — If your change affects the user-facing behavior, update the README.
- **Follow commit conventions** — Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
    ```
    feat: add alias drag-and-drop reordering
    fix: handle missing .gitconfig gracefully
    docs: update installation instructions
    test: add suggest service edge case tests
    ```

---

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript** — All frontend code must be written in TypeScript with strict mode enabled.
- **Rust** — Backend commands and services are written in Rust in `src-tauri/src/`.
- **Naming** — Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components/classes.
- **Components** — Each component gets its own file. Keep components focused and composable.
- **Security** — All Tauri commands must catch errors and return `{ success, error }` results.

---

## Bug Reports

When filing a bug report, please include:

1. **OS and version** (e.g., macOS 14.2, Windows 11, Ubuntu 24.04)
2. **Node.js version** (`node --version`)
3. **pnpm version** (`pnpm --version`)
4. **Steps to reproduce** the issue
5. **Expected vs. actual behavior**
6. **Error messages or screenshots** if applicable
